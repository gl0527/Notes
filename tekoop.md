# Intro

Market is still going up.
Overbidding is not uncommon nowadays.
Deduct of monthly mortgage. <- what does this mean?
older house means
* more maintenance
* worse energy label

house vs apartment
* house requires more maintenance

full ownership vs leasehold
* full ownership is better

Tussenwoning price is less than standalone(vrijstaand) house prices.
But apartments have the lowest prices usually.

# Mortgage
What is my max. mortgage? bonuses, holiday allowance can be used for the calculation.
For how long do I plan to be in the Netherlands?
'Average' price for selling a house in NL: 405k euro.
From january 2024, estimates say that it will be 440k.
NHG reduction of interest rate if buy below average price.
If I am
* younger than 35 years old when I am at the notary
* and buy a property below the average price,

then I won't have to pay transfer tax.

# Property search
Funda is the most popular platform. But it is not so up-to-date.
More up-to-date options:
* social platforms of the broker
* broker websites, or just call him/her

Tips for Funda:
* set price range
* set nr. of bedrooms
* filter for only the absolutely necessary requirements
* overall: be inclusive with your search

# Viewings
Contact real estate agent
* via phone
* in the morning

Apply for a viewing.
Be responsive(for calls, emails, etc.).
At the viewing:
* arrive on time
* have a walkby before to get familiarized with the neighborhood
* ask for taking pictures

# Bidding/negotiating
Sometimes there is a deadline for bidding.
Usually, it is a one-time offer, which is either accepted or rejected.
Have to agree on
* price
* date of transfer
* bank guarantee
* bidding conditions

Verbal agreement is not legally binding, so I can say 'yes' to multiple apartments.
Although it is not nice, and not recommended.

# Mortgage application
Usually the interest rates are higher at bigger banks.
Fixing the interest rate for a very long period is not a good idea now.
Linear vs annuity payments.
Valuation report.
Important: the mortgage covers the *valuation* price mentioned in the valuation report, not the buying price.
Financing cost - 37% back <- what does this mean?
NHG national mortgage guarantee can be used, if the *buying* price is less then 405k euro.
It is a good idea to take NHG, if possible.
Calculation example: if the buying price is 317k euro, then ~8k will be needed for additional costs, like translator, notary, etc.
NHG cost is related to the house price.
Annuity mortgage: gross monthly amount is stable <- does it mean fixed?
Interest rate is tax deductable.
Interest rate is around 4.04% with 10 years fixed.

# Completion/key transfer
Final inspection
* meters are checked and agreed
* gas/water/electricity/internet are there and working

Go to the notary.
List: what is staying, what is going?
* Check that list: are all the 'staying' elements working?

Scratches etc. have to be fixed if they were not here during the viewing (that is why taking pictures is so important).
Building insurance is mandatory.
One becomes the owner when he/she receives the keys.

# Closing thoughts
Bidding should be close to the valuation price.
Mortgage advising: 1st appointment is free!
Technical inspection is not really needed for apartments, since they are usually new.
But it is possible to do, for around 350 euros.
Renting out one room while living in that same house is possible here in Eindhoven.
But it depends on the municipality -> check hospita rules at the municipality.
